# Progressively-Growing-Networks
This is code to several experiments on different dataset (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) on how to grow networks during training 
and to learn new image categories. It is the code underlying my master thesis which is also provided here for a better understanding and 
some additional context.
